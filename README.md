# Balanced Labor Modeling at UW HFS Cafes

<hr>

## Overview
This project contains the data and program necessary to determine the optimal scheduling of employees across University of Washington Cafes.

### Background
Managers of retail cafe establishments often have to balance the amount of workers that
they have at their disposal across all the locations they have authority over. Scheduling the
appropriate amount of employees at the multiple locations is often a difficult task to
undertake especially when there are so many factors that might impact the feasibility of
assignment. Factors such as limits on employee capacity, hours of operation, as well as trends
in customer demand must be considered to make an effective decision at creating a balanced
work schedule. Throughout each day there are varying amounts of customers that make
transactions; there are periods where very few customers come in, and there are times where
customers come in non-stop.

Existing decision making processes result in some locations typically seeing too many 
employees, where the low influx of customers does not justify the amount of workers present at
that moment. Conversely it is also a common occurrence that some other locations have too few
employees juggling tasks and serving a large number of customers without breaks. As such it is
best to balance out staffing appropriate for the customer demand as well as the well-being of
the employees.

### Goal
The goal of this project is to produce a balanced schedule of employee shifts across all UW Cafe locations which minimizes discrepancies between available service and customer demand at each location adhering to lower and upper limits on employee presence at each location and accommodating minimum time constraints on each shift.
